# Project 1: Programmer Compensation Analysis

## Motivation
This project analyzes the factors influencing programmer salaries across different countries. The objective is to uncover trends related to years of experience, education level, job type, and geographic location that drive compensation.

## Libraries Used
- **os** and **shutil**: For filepath operations, reading and saving files, etc.
- **pandas** and **numpy**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For building ML models.

## Files in the Repository
- **project_1.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and modeling of programmer compensation.
- **project_1_functions.py**: Functions file for the project imported into project_1.ipynb.
- **survey_data.xlsx**: Contains the Stack Overflow survey data.

## Results
- **Key Findings**:
  - **The US** has the highest salary scaling for programming jobs compared to other countries.
  - **Years of experience** and **working for large organizations** are the strongest non-country predictors of higher salary across model types.
  - **Education** plays a less significant role in determining compensation than expected, especially in comparison to job experience.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to **Udacity** for providing the dataset and project framework.
- Additional thanks to the authors of any open-source libraries used in the project.
